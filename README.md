# Pegasys Token Asset Registry

This repository is a comprehensive collection of token assets for pooled tokens on the Pegasys DEX.

Such a collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token!_

This repo is intended to be similar to Trust Wallet's asset repository. Token logos are stored according to their Syscoin address under the `tokens` directory. Logos are stored in the format `<token-address>/logo.png`.

Mainnet and testnet token registries are handled independently.

Please make sure to follow the guidelines as this speeds up our review process üòâ
